## Homework
Read through encoder.py and decoder.py, and complete the decoder based on what you learned in class today. You can read through our [README.md] (README.md) code to learn how to run encoder.py and decoder.py. Remember to put your message in a file named "cipheredText.txt" to decode it.


#1. Use the decoder.py you just completed to decode this message: "1101010000101010111110111110111000101001100110111011000111000010".

The key is stuy2022. What is the deciphered text? 

#2. Use the completed decoder.py to decode this message: "01000110000001001100001000011101101100000110000000110010100010010110001100000010011101001001011110011100011101001101100010000000".

The key is the first 64 bits of the deciphered text from #1. What is the deciphered text? 

#3. Use the completed decoder.py to decode this message: "01000111110011110001101000011011000110000111111110010001111101001110011001000000010011001011001000001010111001100011010001111111".

The key is the first 64 bits of the deciphered text from #2. What is the deciphered text? 

#4. Use the completed decoder.py to decode the final message: "10001100011111001110001011111001011101010000011100110111111100100111011110011100100011111101011001111111010110110010101010000100".

The key is the first 64 bits of the deciphered text from #3. What is the deciphered text? 

Submit the missing code of decoder.py and your above answers as a .txt file on Google Classroom.
