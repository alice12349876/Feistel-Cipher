## Homework
Read through encoder.py and decoder.py, and complete the decoder based on what you learned in class today. You can read through our [README.md] (README.md) code


#1. Use the decoder.py you just completed to decode this message: "1101010000101010111110111110111000101001100110111011000111000010" (which you should put in the [cipheredText.txt](cipheredText.txt) file).

The key is stuy2022. What is the deciphered text? 

#2. Use the completed decoder.py to decode this message: "1011100001011011010111000110001100011010111000101101010111000101" (which you should put in the [cipheredText.txt](cipheredText.txt) file).

The key is the deciphered text from #1. 

Submit the missing code of decoder.py and your deciphered message as a .txt file on Google Classroom.
