## May 28th, Saturday
Alice: I reread the Feistel Cipher PDF and watched Youtube lectures to understand the final steps of the algorithm. I discussed the implementation and structure of the code with Si Ying and planned the functions we would use.\

## May 29th, Sunday
Alice: I coded the initial permutation and final permutation of the algorithm. I also coded the 4 parts of the f function: expansion, xor, 8 s-boxes, and straight permutation. I also worked on a string to bits (as a string) and bits (as a string) to string converter.\
Si Ying: I debugged Alice's code, since the permutation tables start with index 1 while arrays in Python start with index 0. I also added the key generation code, which consisted of a parity drop, shifting left, and compression box. I also implemented the Feistel Cipher by putting together our existing functions, and padding bits where strings are not a length of multiple 64.

## May 30th, Monday
Alice: I tested the code and debugged decoder to make sure everything was running smoothly, and we did not miss any cases. I finished up my notes for the presentation, made the homework by taking our code and leaving parts blank for the class to fill in, and ran through everything.\
Si Ying: I finished up debugging the code by fixing the s-box, coded the decoder, and tested the code to make sure we did not miss any cases. I also finished up my notes for the presentation, made the homework by taking our code and leaving parts blank for the class to fill in, and ran through everything.
